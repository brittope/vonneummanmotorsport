Quick website for a college project.

We had to choose a topic for it, I choose a imaginary racing team, had to develop html, css and js skills to complete it, Since I didn't have much time to work in it there were
a few things missing, like a better "races" page, more interactive (fell free to make it, as a challenge).

Had a nice time doing it, I think it helped a lot with my html skills.
